### Assignment

> * Create three new components: GameControl, Odd and Even.
> * The GameControl Component should have buttons to start and stop the game.
> * When starting the game, an event (holding a incrementing number) should get emitted each second (ref = setInterval()).
> * The event should be listenable from outside the component.
> * When stopping the game, no more events should get emitted (clearInterval(ref)).
> * A new Odd component should get created for every odd number emitted, the same should happen for the Even Component (on even numbers).
> * Simply output Odd - NUMBER or Even - NUMBER in the two components.
> * Style the element (e.g. paragraph) holding your output text differently in both components.
